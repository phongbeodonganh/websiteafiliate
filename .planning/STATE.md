## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- No ADR-locked decisions exist (ingest found 0 ADRs) — PROJECT.md records this explicitly
- D-001: V5.2 (specv2.md) governs overlapping spec scope; V3/V4 standing only where V5.2 is silent
- D-002: MongoDB + Mongoose is the datastore (V3/V4 relational schemas superseded)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Standing] Production Atlas credential leaked in git history and still valid — rotation blocked by third-party cluster ownership (SEC-01 residual). Treat migrations/backups as compromised; eventual fix is migrating to a project-owned cluster
- [Phase 1 gate] Next.js 16 contract: read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing code; `proxy.ts` is the middleware; params are Promises
- [Phase 4 input] Current public UI is an editorial theme deviating from V5.2 §3; `BreakingNewsTicker` exists but is orphaned — user approval of the Bento direction is implied by roadmap approval
